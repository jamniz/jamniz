- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jamniz
- The important thing is not to know everything, but to have an idea of the project, to visualize it, to analyze it, to think about how to realize it and to know where to look for the details and concrete knowledge necessary for its realization.
- But above all, you must have the humility to admit that you do not know everything, be open to advice, not rest on your laurels, and always have the desire to learn more.
- I have a strong interest in communication algorithms in the broadest sense, whether they are computer-based, linguistic, verbal and non-verbal, I try to analyze them and learn more. I would like to transform this passion, particularly for computer development, into a professional opportunity.
- <em>My quest for skills is never over. Each line of code is an opportunity to learn and every challenge encountered is a chance to grow.</em>
